## Forgot Password

Here we allow the user to enter their email address to receive a password reset link.

## Forgot Password - Success ðŸŽ‰

Instead of just showing a little notification, we can show a whole page to the user to let them know that the email has been sent.

## Reset Password

After the user clicks on the link in the email, they will be taken to the reset password page.
