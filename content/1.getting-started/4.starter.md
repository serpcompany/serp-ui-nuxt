description: Quickly create a Nuxt 3 project with the UI Thing starter.
---

## Demo

The starter is deployed on Netlify [here](https://ui-thing-starter.behonbaker.com/)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9e570d21-e44f-434b-9924-b92eefecc589/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/resilient-bombolone-7b8e00/deploys)

## Getting Started

**Clone the repo**

```bash
npx --yes giget@latest gh:BayBreezy/nuxt-ui-thing-starter my-nuxt-app --install
```

The `--yes` flag will automatically answer yes when `npx` asks if you want to download the latest version of `giget`. The `--install` flag will automatically install the dependencies after the project is created.

The project will be created in a directory called `my-nuxt-app`.

## Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What's included?

- All the components from UI Thing
  - So this may impact performance. I'm not sure. I would recommend that you delete the components that you do not need.
- [Notivue](https://notivuedocs.netlify.app/installation/nuxt.html) was also added to the project.
  - This is not needed, I just wanted another toast library to play with. Feel free to remove it if VueSonner or the built in toast works for you.
- Pinia
  - This can be removed if you don't need it as well.
