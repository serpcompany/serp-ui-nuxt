title: Introduction
description: Re-usable components built using Radix-Vue & TailwindCSS. All inspired by shadcn/ui.

## You copied `shadcn/ui`?

Yes, this is a copy of the shadcn/ui components but for Nuxt 3.

## Why? There is already `shadcn-vue`

Well, I wanted to experiment and make something Nuxt 3 specific. I also wanted to see the kind of work involved in creating something of this magnitude. I also wanted to create a CLI that i can use on a regular :)

Overall, I wanted to learn and have fun in the process.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

_Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries._
